<img src="spotify_epaper_preview.jpg">

Yes I am using the Nintendo DS BIOS font for this project because it looks beautiful. Two Spotify users' current listening, or recent listening are displayed along with the musical context
The e-paper display updates in full every 3 minutes per Waveshare's recommendations. Open invite to email me, atscott@ucsc.edu, if you have any questions regarding my implementation, or comments regaring how to improve this project.
